TODOs:
- setup linux server remote with ssh login (something only i can use?)
- find out how the login flow works and adjust the login expect bot to correctly anticipate it
- when the login happens need to interact with current session


# while the user is not done
	# continue to add accounts?

	vim ~/Desktop/test.json
	
	echo "reached here"


	# preformat text like the git commit config
	# write over it temporarily
	# allow users to enter and save the data
	# after saving the data reset the format
	# write to file
	# use awk to filter out the first string item

	# update logic is similar in the sense that ur only just adding on to it
