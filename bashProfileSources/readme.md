# list of alias' and exports

## WHY THIS EXISTS!
- I didn't want to be intrusive to anyone running the script(myself included), so I just made it so the exports and all aliases are just sourced in the 2 shell files found inside this directory.
- Setting to bin requires SUDO (which should not be used unless really required!)
- Makes it easier for me to sync my dev env across all machines with just a simple version control
- IF you want to add more alias feel free to just add them here to make ur bashrc or profile look cleaner!
